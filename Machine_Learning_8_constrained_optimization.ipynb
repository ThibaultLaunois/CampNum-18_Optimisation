    "The knapsack problem is a classic combinatorial optimization problem, where one must maximize the total value of the objects put in the knapsack, without exceeding the knapsack capacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Read more about the knapsack problem : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The knapsack problem is called an integer problem as some variable values are constrained to integer values. Here we are going to address the 0-1 knapsack, where we can put only once each object in the knapsack. Problems where variable values are constrained to be 0 or 1 are a subtype of integer problems called boolean problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "All integer problems are non-convex problems, and we do not know any algorithms to solve them in polynomial time (as they are NP-Hard problems https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hardness ).\n",
    "\n",
    "However CVXPY integrates Mixed-Integer solvers that can solve such problems if they are small enough.\n",

    "In this problem you have $k$ electricity production plants, in which there are a total of $n_o$ production units, and for each of them you have its production history as a time series of length *m*. Unfortunately, you don't know which unit belongs to which plant, and some units production history are missing (you only have $n$ units history available), but you know the total production history of each plant. Given these informations, re-assign each unit to its production plant. When you're done try to change the number of plants and the missing ratio to see how far your solution correctly works."
